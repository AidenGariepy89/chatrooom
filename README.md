# Chat room with a marketable name

Oh yeah

Lets go!

# Build Project

1. Create a `build` directory in the project root.
2. In that directory, run `cmake ..` (this runs the CMakeLists.txt file in the root).
3. Then, run `make` (this actually compiles the program)
4. Run the binary located in `build/bin/chatroom`.

As long as you don't change CMakeLists.txt, you should only have to run `make` for any new changes.
